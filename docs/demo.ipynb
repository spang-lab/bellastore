    "# Bellastore Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this demo is to showcase the main functionality of this package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of `bellastore` is to organize whole slide image (WSI) scans both on a filesystem as well as on a database level.\n",
    "Therefore, `bellastore` creates and manages an ingress and a storage database and moves valid WSI files from ingress to storage within the file system and records this within the databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ultimately leads to a comprehensive storage databse that can efficiently be queried in order to retrieve files from a storage containing possibly tens of thousands of WSIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand the ingress database serves the purpose of recording the origin of the files. Often clinical labs encode valuable information in folder and file names which are directly recorded in the ingress database. Thus, even after moving and renaming at the storage level all the original source metadata is tracked.\\\\\n",
    "Furthermore the ingress serves the purpose of only allowing slides to the storage that are not already tracked. It still records a new possible duplicate in the ingress (as it could hold valuable metadata), but the WSI will not procedd to the storage. WSI identity is checked by hashing the file to moved which is the main time consuming point within the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of `bellastore` is that the storage database allows for being extended in the spirit of relational databses with all sorts of metadata, like patient identifiers, clinical grades, cohort identifiers, etc."
